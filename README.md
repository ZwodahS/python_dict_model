# Overview

PythonDictModel is a simple model definition library that allow you to define a model that represent your python dictionary.
It does not tied itself to any database and thus will not be able to perform any relationship mapping.

# Structure

The definition library is only a single file (and will always be) in a single file (dict\_model.py).
You can just copy this file directly into your project and it will be usable.

Extensions to the original library will be storeed in the extension folders.
These extensions are to be used as Mixins to your models.
This will allow you to use only the extensions that you need.

# Requirements
* Python3
